# bootstrap-pokemon-website
My first website about pokemon

I chose to create a pokemon website because I felt that it would be good to give a fans opinion on how good the main games 
since most websites give them all 8 out of 10 whereas I think that some games are better then that 
and 1 or 2 are actually slightly less then that score.

I also have videos and links to other websites/youtubers that I have used in the past I found all of these by chance 
so I thought it would be a good idea to add links so that they are easier to find.

I used <link> and <iframe> tags to get the videos and links onto my website.

The images that I used on the website were all taken by me and were all pokemon games that I owned.

I hope you enjoy the website.
